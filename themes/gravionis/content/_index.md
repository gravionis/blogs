This blog is designed as a utilitarian space for sharing technical notes, ideas & solutions â€” with zero (or even a -1) emphasis on aesthetics or visual presentation. There has been no attempt to make the site look polished or impressive; design was entirely set aside in favor of simplicity and focus. Functional knowledge base that prioritizes clarity, quick updates and easy referencing.

Each post tries to follow a structured approach: it explores the underlying technology or concept evaluates real-world use cases, measures key factors like scalability, complexity, cost, reliability, and flexibility, and highlights relevant trade-offs. Finally, it offers practical recommendations based on this analysis without any distractions from form or flair.
