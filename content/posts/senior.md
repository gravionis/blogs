Each question targets specific competencies: architectural decision-making, operational resilience, performance optimization, security implementation, team coordination and behavioural. The questions are designed to reveal whether you've actually solved these problems in production, not just read about them. The best answers demonstrate practical wisdom gained from building systems that handle millions of requests, managing teams across multiple services, and making architectural decisions under real-world constraints.

## Attitude questions

This collection features interview questions designed for truthful candidates. These questions test your ability to think swiftly, defend difficult decisions and demonstrate self-awareness while handling criticism gracefully.

## **LEADERSHIP & MANAGEMENT**

### **1. The Hero Complex**

#### Primary Question
"Tell me about a time when your team succeeded primarily because of your individual contribution."

#### Likely Follow-ups
- "So your team can't function without you? That sounds like poor delegation and team development."
- "If you were that critical, doesn't that make you a single point of failure?"
- "How do we know you're not taking credit for team effort?"

#### Best Answer Strategy
- **Acknowledge the paradox**: "I understand this creates a dependency concern."
- **Frame as temporary**: Explain it was a crisis situation or knowledge transfer period
- **Show team development**: Describe how you immediately worked to distribute that knowledge/capability
- **Focus on enablement**: "My goal was to unblock the team so they could succeed"
- **Include humility**: Acknowledge team contributions even in your moment

#### Sample Response Framework
"During a critical system outage, I had the specific technical knowledge needed to resolve it quickly. However, I immediately documented the solution and conducted team training sessions to ensure this dependency wouldn't exist in future incidents. The real success was building team capability, not just solving the immediate problem."

---

### **2. The Loyalty Test**

#### Primary Question
"Describe a situation where you had to choose between loyalty to your team and loyalty to your company."

#### Likely Follow-ups
- "So you chose the company over your people? How can your team trust you?"
- "If you chose your team, how can the company trust you to make tough business decisions?"
- "Isn't this a false choice? Good leaders find a way to do both."

#### Best Answer Strategy
- **Reframe the conflict**: Show how you tried to align team and company interests
- **Demonstrate values**: Explain the principles that guided your decision
- **Show transparency**: Describe how you communicated with both sides
- **Own the difficulty**: Acknowledge it was genuinely hard
- **Focus on long-term**: Explain how your decision served both parties ultimately

#### Sample Response Framework
"When budget cuts threatened my team, I chose to be transparent with everyone about the business reality while advocating strongly for alternatives. I couldn't promise what I couldn't deliver, but I could ensure my team had time to prepare and that leadership understood the true impact of their decisions."

---

### **3. The Perfectionist Trap**

#### Primary Question
"Tell me about a time you delivered something that wasn't up to your usual standards."

#### Likely Follow-ups
- "So you knowingly delivered poor quality? How do we trust you with important projects?"
- "If it wasn't up to standards, why didn't you push back on the deadline?"
- "Doesn't this show you can't manage competing priorities effectively?"

#### Best Answer Strategy
- **Context is key**: Explain the trade-offs clearly (time, resources, scope)
- **Show decision framework**: Describe how you evaluated options
- **Risk mitigation**: Explain safeguards you put in place
- **Communication**: Show how you managed stakeholder expectations
- **Learning**: Demonstrate what you'd do differently

#### Sample Response Framework
"Faced with a critical customer deadline, I delivered an MVP that met core requirements but lacked some polish features I typically include. I clearly communicated the trade-offs to stakeholders, implemented monitoring to catch issues early, and scheduled immediate follow-up iterations to address the gaps."

---

## **ETHICAL & MORAL DILEMMAS**

### **4. The Whistleblower Scenario**

#### Primary Question
"Describe a time you discovered something unethical at your workplace. What did you do?"

#### Likely Follow-ups
- "If you reported it, how do we know you won't create problems here by being overly sensitive?"
- "If you didn't report it, how can we trust you to maintain our ethical standards?"
- "Why didn't you try to handle it internally first/escalate further?"

#### Best Answer Strategy
- **Show principled thinking**: Explain your ethical framework
- **Demonstrate judgment**: Show you can distinguish between minor issues and serious problems
- **Process matters**: Describe how you approached it systematically
- **Consider consequences**: Show you thought through impacts on all parties
- **Professional growth**: Explain what you learned about handling such situations

#### Sample Response Framework
"I discovered a data handling practice that violated customer privacy policies. I first documented the issue thoroughly, then approached my manager with a proposed solution. When that didn't resolve it, I escalated through proper channels while continuing to protect our customers' data in my daily work."

---

### **5. The Diversity Dilemma**

#### Primary Question
"Tell me about a time you had to make a hiring decision between a diverse candidate and a more qualified candidate."

#### Likely Follow-ups
- "So you admit you sometimes prioritize demographics over qualifications?"
- "If you chose the 'more qualified' candidate, how do you demonstrate commitment to diversity?"
- "Isn't framing it this way problematic? What makes you think one was 'more qualified'?"

#### Best Answer Strategy
- **Challenge the premise**: Question the assumption that diversity and qualification are opposing
- **Expand definition**: Discuss different types of qualifications and value
- **Process focus**: Describe your structured, bias-aware hiring process
- **Long-term thinking**: Explain how diversity contributes to team performance
- **Continuous improvement**: Show how you've refined your hiring approach

#### Sample Response Framework
"I don't see diversity and qualification as competing factors. When evaluating candidates, I look at multiple dimensions of value they bring - technical skills, different perspectives, cultural fit, and growth potential. I've learned that diverse teams consistently outperform homogeneous ones, so diversity is actually a qualification for team success."
