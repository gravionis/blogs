LLM design patterns are reusable strategies for building robust, efficient, and scalable AI applications. They help developers structure retrieval, reading, rewriting, memory, agent, and orchestration workflows for large language models. These patterns improve performance, maintainability accuracy, cost and security.

## Introduction

Here we explore how to leverage Gen AI on AWS. We cover key concepts, model types, prompt engineering, embeddings, RAG, vector stores, and design patterns for building effective AI solutions.

## Key Concepts
- Foundation Models (FMs): Pre-trained models like GPT, BERT, and DALL-E that consists of billions of parameters (aka weights) trained on vast datasets.
- Pre training: Training on large datasets to learn general patterns. Foundational models trained on large diverse datasets over a period of weeks or months using large cluster of CPUs/GPUs/TPUs.
- Fine tuning: Adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks using smaller, task-specific datasets.
