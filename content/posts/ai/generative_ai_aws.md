| **Category**                | **Service / Feature**                       | **Description** |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Foundation & Deployment** | **Amazon Bedrock** | Fully managed platform providing access to multiple foundation models (Anthropic Claude, Cohere, Stability AI, etc.), enabling customization, RAG, guardrails, and agent creation. |
|                             | **Amazon SageMaker** | End-to-end ML platform for training, deploying, and managing generative AI models. Includes JumpStart, fine-tuning, pipelines, and integrated tools for experimentation. |
|                             | **AI Infrastructure** | High-performance hardware for generative AI workloads (EC2 P5 instances with NVIDIA H100 GPUs, AWS Trainium & Inferentia for cost-efficient training and inference). |
|                             | **Amazon Nova** | AWS’s own foundation model family optimized for performance and scalability. |
| **Generative AI Applications** | **Amazon Q (Business & Developer)** | Pre-built assistants leveraging Bedrock for business workflows and developer productivity. |
|                             | **Amazon Bedrock Agents** | Enables building and orchestrating multi-agent systems for automated workflows and task execution. |
|                             | **Model Distillation** | AWS tools to compress large models into smaller, cost-efficient versions without major performance loss. |
| **Safety & Responsible AI** | **Guardrails in Bedrock** | Pre-built safety and moderation features to prevent harmful or inappropriate outputs. |
|                             | **Automated Reasoning** | Logic-based system for verifying correctness and enforcing compliance in model outputs. |
| **Data & Context Enrichment** | **Knowledge Bases & RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation support in Bedrock for grounding models with enterprise data. |
|                             | **AWS Data Foundation Services** | Secure, scalable data infrastructure for high-quality pipelines to feed generative AI systems. |
| **Architecture & Best Practices** | **Generative AI Stack & Lens** | Layered architecture and AWS Well-Architected Generative AI Lens for building scalable and secure solutions. |
|                             | **Prescriptive Guidance** | Reference architectures and patterns for enterprise-ready generative AI adoption. |
| **Training & Enablement** | **Innovation Center** | AWS experts help with strategy, roadmapping, and adoption of generative AI in enterprises. |
|                             | **Training Courses** | Courses like “Generative AI Essentials” and “Developing Generative AI Applications” to build expertise. |
| **Marketplace & Partner Ecosystem** | **AWS Marketplace GenAI Solutions** | Curated marketplace for third-party generative AI tools, foundation models, and services. |
|                             | **Partner Integrations** | Integrations with partners (e.g., Pegasystems, Loka) for advanced workflows and modernization. |
