## Attitude questions

This collection features interview questions designed for truthful candidates. These questions test your ability to think swiftly, defend difficult decisions and demonstrate self-awareness while handling criticism gracefully.

## **LEADERSHIP & MANAGEMENT**

### **1. The Hero Complex**

#### Primary Question
"Tell me about a time when your team succeeded primarily because of your individual contribution."

#### Likely Follow-ups
- "So your team can't function without you? That sounds like poor delegation and team development."
- "If you were that critical, doesn't that make you a single point of failure?"
- "How do we know you're not taking credit for team effort?"

#### Best Answer Strategy
- **Acknowledge the paradox**: "I understand this creates a dependency concern."
- **Frame as temporary**: Explain it was a crisis situation or knowledge transfer period
- **Show team development**: Describe how you immediately worked to distribute that knowledge/capability
- **Focus on enablement**: "My goal was to unblock the team so they could succeed"
- **Include humility**: Acknowledge team contributions even in your moment

#### Sample Response Framework
"During a critical system outage, I had the specific technical knowledge needed to resolve it quickly. However, I immediately documented the solution and conducted team training sessions to ensure this dependency wouldn't exist in future incidents. The real success was building team capability, not just solving the immediate problem."

---

### **2. The Loyalty Test**

#### Primary Question
"Describe a situation where you had to choose between loyalty to your team and loyalty to your company."

#### Likely Follow-ups
- "So you chose the company over your people? How can your team trust you?"
- "If you chose your team, how can the company trust you to make tough business decisions?"
- "Isn't this a false choice? Good leaders find a way to do both."

#### Best Answer Strategy
- **Reframe the conflict**: Show how you tried to align team and company interests
- **Demonstrate values**: Explain the principles that guided your decision
- **Show transparency**: Describe how you communicated with both sides
- **Own the difficulty**: Acknowledge it was genuinely hard
- **Focus on long-term**: Explain how your decision served both parties ultimately

#### Sample Response Framework
"When budget cuts threatened my team, I chose to be transparent with everyone about the business reality while advocating strongly for alternatives. I couldn't promise what I couldn't deliver, but I could ensure my team had time to prepare and that leadership understood the true impact of their decisions."

---

### **3. The Perfectionist Trap**

#### Primary Question
"Tell me about a time you delivered something that wasn't up to your usual standards."

#### Likely Follow-ups
- "So you knowingly delivered poor quality? How do we trust you with important projects?"
- "If it wasn't up to standards, why didn't you push back on the deadline?"
- "Doesn't this show you can't manage competing priorities effectively?"

#### Best Answer Strategy
- **Context is key**: Explain the trade-offs clearly (time, resources, scope)

- **Risk mitigation**: Explain safeguards you put in place
- **Communication**: Show how you managed stakeholder expectations

## **ETHICAL & MORAL DILEMMAS**

### **4. The Whistleblower Scenario**

#### Primary Question
"Describe a time you discovered something unethical at your workplace. What did you do?"

---

### **5. The Diversity Dilemma**

#### Primary Question
"Tell me about a time you had to make a hiring decision between a diverse candidate and a more qualified candidate."

#### Likely Follow-ups
- "So you admit you sometimes prioritize demographics over qualifications?"
