This collection serves as a reference for understanding the diverse human and technical factors that shape software development and system design. It highlights how natural laws, engineering principles, organizational dynamics, and cognitive limits influence outcomes, reminding us that building effective systems requires balancing complexity, resilience, people, and technology.

## Laws

### Physics & Natural Science Laws Applied to Software
* **Second Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy)** – In isolated systems, entropy always increases over time; software systems naturally tend toward disorder and complexity without deliberate maintenance.
* **First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation of Energy)** – Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed; computational resources are finite and must be allocated efficiently.
* **Newton's First Law (Inertia)** – Objects at rest stay at rest; established codebases resist change, and changing systems require sustained effort.
* **Newton's Third Law** – For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction; every feature addition has consequences elsewhere in the system.
* **Conservation of Mass** – Matter cannot be created or destroyed; technical debt accumulates and must eventually be addressed somewhere in the system.
* **Chaos Theory/Butterfly Effect** – Small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes; minor code changes can have unexpected system-wide effects.
* **Le Chatelier's Principle** – Systems under stress will shift to counteract that stress; software systems develop workarounds and compensating mechanisms when under load.
* **Ohm's Law (V = IR)** – Voltage equals current times resistance; system performance equals throughput divided by bottlenecks.
* **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle** – You cannot precisely measure both position and momentum simultaneously; observing a system changes its behavior (monitoring overhead, debugging effects).
* **Law of Conservation of Complexity** – Complexity cannot be destroyed, only moved; simplifying one part of a system often increases complexity elsewhere.

### Biological & Evolutionary Principles
* **Natural Selection** – Systems that adapt to their environment survive; software that doesn't evolve becomes obsolete.
* **Survival of the Fittest** – The most adaptable solutions, not necessarily the strongest, survive in changing environments.
* **Symbiosis** – Different components can benefit from working together; microservices and APIs create mutual dependencies.
* **Genetic Drift** – Random changes accumulate over time; codebases diverge from original design through incremental changes.
* **Punctuated Equilibrium** – Evolution occurs in bursts separated by stable periods; software development cycles between rapid change and stability.
* **Homeostasis** – Living systems maintain stable internal conditions despite external changes; robust software maintains consistent behavior despite varying loads.
* **Sexual Selection** – Features evolve not for survival but for attractiveness; software features are sometimes added for marketing appeal rather than utility.

### Mathematical & Logical Principles
* **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems** – In any sufficiently complex formal system, there are true statements that cannot be proven within the system; complete specification of complex software is impossible.
* **Halting Problem** – You cannot determine if an arbitrary program will halt; perfect static analysis tools are theoretically impossible.
* **No Free Lunch Theorem** – No optimization algorithm performs better than random search across all possible problems; there is no universally best solution.
* **Pigeonhole Principle** – If you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item; system constraints create inevitable conflicts.
* **Central Limit Theorem** – Large samples tend toward normal distribution; aggregate system behaviors become predictable even when individual components are chaotic.

* **Brooks's Law** – "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." (From *The Mythical Man-Month*)
* **Ninety-Ninety Rule** – The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time; the remaining 10% accounts for the other 90%.
* **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)** – 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
* **Student Syndrome** – Work on a task will not begin in earnest until just before the deadline.

* **Atwood's Law** – Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.
* **Greenspun's Tenth Rule** – Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad-hoc, buggy, slow Lisp implementation.
* **Bentley's Rule** – More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency than for any other single reason.
* **Kernighan's Law** – Debugging is twice as hard as writing code. If you write code as cleverly as possible, you’re not smart enough to debug it.
* **Spolsky's Law of Leaky Abstractions** – All non-trivial abstractions are, to some degree, leaky.
* **Schröder’s Law of Software Evolution** – Software that works is always considered "legacy."

### Information Theory & Communication
* **Shannon's Theorem** – There is a fundamental limit to lossless data compression; information has inherent complexity that cannot be reduced indefinitely.

  → In practice: APIs should strictly define outputs but be tolerant to varied inputs.
* **Clark’s Law of Protocols** – A protocol is only as strong as its weakest implementation.  
* **Saltzer’s End-to-End Principle** – Functions in a system should be implemented at the highest layer where they can be correctly and completely implemented.
