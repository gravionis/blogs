Key DDD Concepts Identified:

- Entities: Things with identity that change over time (Users, Videos, Channels, Comments)
- Value Objects: Immutable descriptors (Metadata, Tags, Preferences)
- Domain Events: Significant business occurrences (VideoUploaded, UserSubscribed)
- Domain Services: Business logic that doesn't belong to entities (Search, Moderation)

## 2a. Microservice Decomposition & Hexagonal Architecture (Chris Richardson)

### Decomposition Strategies (from "Microservices Patterns")
- **By Business Capability**: Decompose services around business domains (e.g., Video Management, User Management, Social Interactions, Analytics).
- **By Subdomain (DDD)**: Identify core, supporting, and generic subdomains (e.g., Video Processing as core, Notification as supporting).
- **By Transaction Boundary**: Services should own their data and transactional boundaries (e.g., Video Upload and Processing as separate services).
- **By Team Ownership**: Align services with team boundaries for independent delivery.

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- **Service Core**: Business logic is isolated from external systems.
- **Ports**: Define interfaces for driving (API, UI) and driven (DB, messaging, external APIs) adapters.
- **Adapters**: Implement ports for REST, gRPC, Kafka, databases, etc.
- **Benefits**: Improves testability, flexibility, and separation of concerns.

#### Example: Video Upload Service (Hexagonal)
- **Core**: Handles upload validation, metadata extraction, and orchestration.
- **Inbound Adapter**: REST API for receiving uploads.
- **Outbound Adapters**: Kafka producer for events, S3 adapter for storage, DB adapter for metadata.

### Additional Patterns from the Book
- **API Composition**: Aggregate data from multiple services for UI.
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its schema.
- **Saga Pattern**: Manage distributed transactions (e.g., video upload workflow).
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write models for scalability.
- **Event Sourcing**: Persist state changes as events for auditability.
- **Service Mesh**: Use a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for managing service-to-service communication, observability, and security.
- **Externalized Configuration**: Store configuration outside the service for flexibility and easier deployments.
- **Centralized Log Management**: Aggregate logs for all services to enable monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Health Check API**: Each service exposes a health check endpoint for orchestration and monitoring.
- **Consumer-Driven Contracts**: Ensure service integrations are reliable and changes do not break consumers.
- **Testing Strategies**: Include contract testing, component testing, and end-to-end testing for microservices.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Implement tracing to follow requests across service boundaries for observability.
- **Service Template/Boilerplate**: Use standardized templates to accelerate new service development and enforce best practices.

## 14. Key Principles and Laws Applied

### Performance Laws
- **Little's Law**: Average number of items in a queuing system equals the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time an item spends in the system.
- **Amdahl's Law**: The speedup of a program from parallelization is limited by the sequential portion.
- **Universal Scalability Law**: Models the impact of contention and coherency delays in distributed systems.

### Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service has one clear purpose.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Services should be open for extension, closed for modification.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
- **Fail Fast**: Detect and report errors immediately.

### Reliability Patterns
- **Bulkhead**: Isolate resources to prevent cascading failures.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent calls to failing services.
- **Timeout**: Set maximum wait times for all operations.
- **Idempotency**: Safe to retry operations multiple times.

### Additional Laws and Principles
- **Murphy's Law**: "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong." Design for failure and recovery.
- **Conway's Law**: System design mirrors the communication structure of the organization.
- **Occam's Razor**: Prefer the simplest solution that works.
- **Robustness Principle (Postel's Law)**: "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept."
- **Law of Demeter**: Minimize coupling by only interacting with immediate collaborators.
- **Hofstadter's Law**: "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."
- **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**: 80% of effects come from 20% of causes; optimize for the critical path.
- **Peter Principle**: In hierarchical organizations, people tend to be promoted to their level of incompetence (impacts team/org design).
- **Gall's Law**: A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.

## 15. Database Design

### User Service Database
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_login TIMESTAMP
);

-- Channels table
CREATE TABLE channels (
    channel_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT REFERENCES users(user_id),
    channel_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    subscriber_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Subscriptions table (sharded by user_id)
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
    subscription_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    subscriber_id BIGINT REFERENCES users(user_id),
    channel_id BIGINT REFERENCES channels(channel_id),
    subscribed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(subscriber_id, channel_id)
);
```

### Video Service Database
```sql
-- Videos table (sharded by video_id hash)
CREATE TABLE videos (
    video_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    channel_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    duration INTEGER, -- in seconds
    view_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    like_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    dislike_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    upload_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    processing_status ENUM('uploading', 'processing', 'ready', 'failed'),
    visibility ENUM('public', 'private', 'unlisted')
);

-- Video metadata table
CREATE TABLE video_metadata (
    video_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES videos(video_id),
    file_size BIGINT,
    codec VARCHAR(50),
    resolution VARCHAR(20),
    bitrate INTEGER,
    thumbnail_url VARCHAR(500),
    tags TEXT[] -- PostgreSQL array for tags
);

-- Comments table (sharded by video_id)
CREATE TABLE comments (
    comment_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    video_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    parent_comment_id BIGINT, -- for replies
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    like_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 16. API Design

### REST API Endpoints

#### Video Operations
```http
# Upload video
POST /api/v1/videos
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

# Get video details
GET /api/v1/videos/{videoId}

PUT /api/v1/videos/{videoId}

# Delete video
DELETE /api/v1/videos/{videoId}

# Search videos
GET /api/v1/videos/search?q={query}&limit={limit}&offset={offset}

# Get trending videos
GET /api/v1/videos/trending?category={category}&region={region}
```

#### User Operations
```http
# User registration
POST /api/v1/users/register

# User login
POST /api/v1/users/login

# Get user profile
GET /api/v1/users/{userId}

# Subscribe to channel
POST /api/v1/users/{userId}/subscriptions/{channelId}

# Get user subscriptions
GET /api/v1/users/{userId}/subscriptions
```

#### Social Operations
```http

POST /api/v1/videos/{videoId}/comments

# Get comments
GET /api/v1/videos/{videoId}/comments?limit={limit}&offset={offset}

# Reply to comment
POST /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/replies
```

### GraphQL Schema (Alternative)
```graphql
type Video {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  duration: Int!
  viewCount: Int!
  likeCount: Int!
  uploadTime: String!
  channel: Channel!
  comments(first: Int, after: String): CommentConnection
}

type Channel {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  subscriberCount: Int!
  videos(first: Int, after: String): VideoConnection
}

type Query {
  video(id: ID!): Video
  searchVideos(query: String!, first: Int, after: String): VideoConnection
  trendingVideos(category: String, region: String): [Video!]!
}

type Mutation {
  uploadVideo(input: VideoInput!): Video
  likeVideo(videoId: ID!): Video
  addComment(videoId: ID!, content: String!): Comment
}
```

## 17. Caching Strategy

### Multi-Level Caching
```yaml
# Level 1: Browser Cache
- Static assets: 1 year
- Video thumbnails: 1 week
- API responses: 5 minutes

# Level 2: CDN Cache (CloudFlare/CloudFront)
- Video segments: 1 day
- Thumbnails: 1 week
- API responses: 1 minute

# Level 3: Application Cache (Redis)
- Popular video metadata: 1 hour
- User sessions: 24 hours
- Search results: 15 minutes
- Trending videos: 30 minutes

# Level 4: Database Query Cache
- Complex analytics queries: 5 minutes
- User profile data: 30 minutes
- Channel information: 1 hour
```

### Cache Invalidation Strategy
- **Time-based**: TTL for most cached data
- **Event-based**: Invalidate on video updates, user actions
- **Version-based**: Cache keys include version numbers
- **Write-through**: Update cache and database simultaneously
- **Write-behind**: Async cache updates for non-critical data

## 18. Message Queue Architecture

### Kafka Topic Design
```yaml
# Video Processing Topics
video-upload-events:
  partitions: 100
  replication-factor: 3
  retention: 7 days

video-transcoding-jobs:
  partitions: 50
  replication-factor: 3
  retention: 3 days

video-ready-events:
  partitions: 100
  replication-factor: 3
  retention: 30 days

# User Activity Topics
user-view-events:
  partitions: 200
  replication-factor: 3
  retention: 90 days

user-interaction-events:
  partitions: 100
  replication-factor: 3
  retention: 30 days

# Notification Topics
subscription-notifications:
  partitions: 50
  replication-factor: 3
  retention: 7 days
```

### Event Schema (Avro)
```json
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "VideoUploadEvent",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "videoId", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "userId", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "channelId", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "filename", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "fileSize", "type": "long"},
    {"name": "contentType", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "uploadTimestamp", "type": "long"},
    {"name": "metadata", "type": {"type": "map", "values": "string"}}
  ]
}
```

## 19. Load Balancing Strategy

### Geographic Load Balancing
```yaml
# DNS-based routing
Global Load Balancer:
  - US-East: 40% traffic
  - US-West: 20% traffic
  - Europe: 25% traffic
  - Asia-Pacific: 15% traffic

# Regional Load Balancers
Regional LB (L7):
  - Path-based routing: /api/upload → Upload Service
  - Header-based routing: User-Agent → Mobile/Web Service
  - Weighted routing: Canary deployments

# Service Load Balancers (L4)
Service Discovery:
  - Health checks every 30 seconds
  - Circuit breaker: 5 failures in 60 seconds
  - Load balancing algorithms: Weighted round-robin
```

### Auto-scaling Configuration
```yaml
# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (Kubernetes)
Video Upload Service:
  minReplicas: 10
  maxReplicas: 100
  targetCPUUtilization: 70%
  targetMemoryUtilization: 80%
  scaleUpStabilization: 60s
  scaleDownStabilization: 300s

Video Streaming Service:
  minReplicas: 50
  maxReplicas: 500
  targetCPUUtilization: 60%
  customMetrics:
    - concurrent_streams_per_pod: 1000
```

## 20. Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics Dashboard
```yaml
# Golden Signals
Latency:
  - Video start time: P50, P95, P99
  - API response time: P50, P95, P99
  - Upload processing time: P50, P95, P99

Traffic:
  - Requests per second by endpoint
  - Concurrent video streams
  - Upload requests per minute

Errors:
  - HTTP error rates (4xx, 5xx)
  - Video processing failures
  - Database connection errors

Saturation:
  - CPU utilization across services
  - Memory usage patterns
  - Queue depth in Kafka topics
  - Storage utilization
```

### Alert Rules
```yaml
# Critical Alerts (PagerDuty)
Video Start Failure Rate > 1%:
  severity: critical
  notification: immediate

API Error Rate > 5%:
  severity: critical
  notification: immediate

Database Connection Pool > 90%:
  severity: critical
  notification: immediate

# Warning Alerts (Slack)
Upload Processing Time > P95:
  severity: warning
  notification: 5-minute delay

CDN Cache Hit Rate < 85%:
  severity: warning
  notification: 10-minute delay
```
